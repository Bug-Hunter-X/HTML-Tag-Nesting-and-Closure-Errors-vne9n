<p>This is a common error in HTML, but it can be difficult to track down.  It occurs when you accidentally include a tag within another tag where it doesn't belong. For example:</p><code><div><p>This is some text</p><h1>This is a heading</h1></div></code><p>The problem here is that the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is nested inside the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. While this is not strictly illegal in HTML, it can cause issues with the layout and styling of your document and could lead to unexpected results in some browsers.</p><p>Another example is accidentally closing a tag in the wrong place, leading to nested element mismatches:</p><code><p>This is a paragraph. <span>This is some span text</p> </span></code><p>Here, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is closed prematurely, before the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag is closed, leading to malformed HTML.</p>
