<p>The solution involves carefully checking the opening and closing tags in your HTML to ensure proper nesting.  Using a good code editor with HTML validation can help to prevent this type of error.</p><p>Here's the corrected code from the example:</p><code><div><p>This is some text</p><p><h1>This is a heading</h1></p></div></code><p>or perhaps</p><code><div><h1>This is a heading</h1><p>This is some text</p></div></code><p>Notice that the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag should not be nested inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag unless specifically styled to be within a paragraph. It's generally better to use appropriate semantic tags at the correct levels.</p><p>For the second example:</p><code><p>This is a paragraph. <span>This is some span text</span></p></code><p>The closing tags are now in the correct order, ensuring that all tags are properly nested and closed.</p><p>Using a code editor with an integrated linter can greatly help avoid such errors.  Linters will flag errors and warnings like these as you type.</p>
