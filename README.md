# HTML Tag Nesting and Closure Errors

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error related to incorrect tag nesting and closure.  Improperly nested or unclosed tags can lead to unpredictable layout and rendering problems across different browsers. This example shows how these errors can manifest and provides a solution for fixing them.

**Files:**

* `bug.html`: Contains the HTML code with the nesting error.
* `bugSolution.html`: Demonstrates the corrected HTML code.

**How to reproduce:** Open `bug.html` in a web browser to observe the layout issue caused by incorrect tag nesting.  Then compare this to `bugSolution.html`, which has the corrected HTML and proper structure.  The solution involves carefully examining and fixing the nesting and closure of tags to produce semantically correct HTML.
